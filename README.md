1. Act, ArrayList<Actor> getActors(), void processActors(ArrayList<Actor> actors), ArrayList<Location selectMoveLocation(ArrayList<Location> locs), void makeMove(Location loc)

2. They will check their surrounding locations, process actors, choose where to move to, move locations, and turn.

3. No because the Critter class was designed to represent actors that process other actors and then move.

4. Change their color, direction, or make them move.

5. void makeMove(Location loc)
	     -Makes the critter move
	ArrayList<Location> getMoveLocations()

	Location selectMoveLocation(ArrayList<Location> locs)

	  Set 8
=================
1. It processes its own actors and makes its own moves

 	   Set 9
==================
1. Because it extends Critter

2. It moves to a location, then it checks the neighbooring areas, if there is another actor there, it moves to that loction and eats the actor.

3. It needs to move in random directions, so it gets the locations and the directions

4. (4,4) (3,5) (2,4) (3,1)

5. A critter can move in any direction, like a king in chess, where the crab can only move side to side.

6. When it runs into another actor.

7. Because they process other actors, not actors in their class.
